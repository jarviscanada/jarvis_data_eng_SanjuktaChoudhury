#
summary: I graduated with mathematics honors and have a master degree in Computer Application and recently acquired Data Analytics Certification.
  I started my career as a Software Developer where I worked for 3.5 years and currently working as Business System Analyst at Jarvis. 
  Experience with coding along with strong analytical skills, I interacted with prospects, stakeholders, and customers to understand business requirements, scope, develop, and deliver quality solutions in the domain of integrated ALM.
  I was always passionate about numbers and statistical analysis and utilize it to find new insights not only professionally but in every aspect of life.
  Having an eye for details and a strong quantitative background, I am excited to combine my previous Software Developer experience with newly acquired Data Analytical skills to enable data decisions making at scale.

    description: "Developed a linux cluster monitoring agent to track the hardware usage in a data center for several planning purpose.
    In this project, elicited the technical requirements, created the BRD and SRD documents defining the project scope, stakeholders, functional and non functional requirements with system sequence diagrams.
    For developement, CentOS 7 was used for development/testing, and Docker was used to run the PostgreSQL instance that stores the host machine's.
    The source code management was done with GitFlow, which is a branching model, and GIT.
    Each host has two bash scripts, and to start the monitoring program, a docker container should be running and the table should be created.
    Testing was done by executing each script and checking if the result meets requirements to ensure that every script runs without issues."
