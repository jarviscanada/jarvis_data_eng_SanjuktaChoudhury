In this project, elicited the technical requirements, created the BRD and SRD documents defining the project scope, stakeholders, functional and non functional requirements with system sequence diagrams. For development, CentOS 7 was used for development/testing, and Docker was used to run the PostgreSQL instance that stores the host machine's. The source code management was done with GitFlow, which is a branching model, and GIT. Each host has two bash scripts, and to start the monitoring program, a docker container should be running and the table should be created. Testing was done by executing each script and checking if the result meets requirements to ensure that every script runs without issues.",
