# Sanjukta Choudhury . Jarvis Consulting

I completed my bachelor's in Mathematics honors and have a master's degree in Computer Application and recently acquired a Data Analytics Certification from SpringBoard School of Data Analytics. I started my career as a Software Developer where I worked for 3.5 years and am currently working as a Business System Analyst at Jarvis. My experience with coding along with strong analytical skills helped me interact with stakeholders, and customers to understand business requirements and project scopes to create Business and Software Documents. I have always been passionate about numbers and statistical analysis and use this skills to find new insights not only professionally but in every aspect of life. I am excited to combine my previous Software Developer experience with newly acquired Data Analytical skills to enable data decisions making at scale.
